# Traffic_sign_classification
# Overview
This project creates and trains a deep convolutional neural network from scratch, with the task of classifying traffic signs using the Traffic Sign Dataset. The trained model is subsequently tested on traffic signs found on the web.


# Dependencies
This project requires Python 3.5 and the following Python libraries installed:

NumPy

SciPy

scikit-learn

TensorFlow

PIL

OpenCV

Dataset


This project uses the Traffic Sign Dataset. A pickled version that has images resized to 32x32 is available here. The pickle file was used as the raw data for this project.

For dataset augmentation, run python aug.py

# How to run
You can step through the Jupyter Notebook at Model_training.ipynb.

Pre-trained model
The model I have trained is saved in model5.h1, as a TensorFlow model.
